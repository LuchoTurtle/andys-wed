# Mandylena's Wed

Wedding website/experience made for Madalena and Andrew's special day.

Created with Three.js, GSAP and Sass. You can find a live demo [here](https://mandylena.pt/).

Illustrations by [Vicente Sampaio](https://vicentesampaio.hotglue.me/start).


## :hatching_chick: Getting Started

As simple as it can be. To run locally, just use `npm` or `yarn`, as you do.

```
npm run dev
```

If you're interested in the production build, simply:
```
npm run build
```

### :bento: Resources

This website uses WebGL through Three.js. I personally created low-poly and baked the textures onto each `.glb` model to make the site performant on any device. You can find some `.blender` files on the `/resources` folder of each model within the website.

#### Acknowledgments
I was inspired immensely by Porter Robinson's Nurture 3D worlds and the jaw-dropping websites developed [Dakumisu](https://github.com/Dakumisu) and [Aristide Benoist](https://www.aristidebenoist.com/). Please, check these lads out, they are :sparkles: amazing :sparkles: at what they do and are a great source of inspiration!
